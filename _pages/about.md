I am a PhD candidate in the Civil, Environmental, and Geodetic Engineering department at the Ohio State University and will graduate in May 2023. My research focus is energy efficiency and sustainability of air conditioning systems & buildings which I selected in response to the greatest challenge of our era, Global Warming.
For my PhD research I have been communicating with researchers from Mechanical, Chemical, & Environmental Engineering to Chemistry, as well as a few private companies, working on a large interdisciplinary effort to develop a solar cooling system using metal-organic frameworks (a new class of sorbent materials).

My personal care for sustainability, deep experience in energy-efficient systems, as well as my communication, and mentoring skills make me believe that academia is where I belong. I enjoy doing research and playing my role to push the boundaries of science and engineering further. Please feel free to contact me (zakerishahvari.1@osu.edu) for more details.
