* Assessed and identified physics that was lacking in the existing model of the ASHRAE Handbook of
Fundamentals for laboratory exhaust dispersions.
* Introduced new optimized parameters to the model and formulated a new model for the ASHRAE
Handbook of Fundamentals that improved the model accuracy and resulted the fan power requirements
offered by the model by 20-70%.
