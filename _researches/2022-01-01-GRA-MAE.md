* Developed discretized dynamic model of energy and mass transport in a solar Metal Organic Framework
(MOF)-based cooling system in Modelica language and EES.
* Articulated pathway to near-theoretical maximum efficiency desiccant dehumidification using MOFs
through extensive physics-based modeling and optimization campaign.
* Developed air conditioning concept with coefficient of performance 2.7-6 times that of traditional
systems.
* Collaborated with Chemists, Chemical Engineers, and private companies to develop air conditioning
system using novel desiccant materials.
* Designed experiments to investigate moisture absorption/desorption performance of MOF-based
membranes under a variety of conditions.
* Led writing efforts on five peer-reviewed papers.
* Characterized flexibility of HVAC loads as part of Connected Communities project.
